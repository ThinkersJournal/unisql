# Changelog

One version number for every crate in the workspace. Pre-1.0, the second number is the breaking one.

## 0.0.3 - 2026-10-13

- `unisql::analyse(sql, source)`: target-free needs extraction (`constructs`, `refused`, `unreadable`),
  backed by a new IR walker in `unisql-core` (`needs::constructs`) and `Allowance::ALL`. Requested by
  the PersistAnt lane for deriving a program's needs from its statement catalogue.

## 0.0.2

- Lane `HANDOFF.md` is no longer tracked and is ignored (hygiene; no code change).

## 0.0.1

- First tracked state of UniSQL: IR, PostgreSQL/SQLite/MySQL/MariaDB readers and writers, parameter
  codec for array parameters, differential suites against real engines, matrix files, first CI.

# Changelog

One version number for every crate in the workspace. Pre-1.0, the second number is the breaking one.

## Unreleased (version allocated by the PM at gate)

- **Breaking (ids, matrix files, `analyse`):** constructs are now leaf ids. `cast` becomes
  `cast.to_<type>`; partial forms get their own leaf (`upsert.no_conflict_key`, `returning.update`,
  `trim.multi_char`, `fn:<agg>.order_by`, `distinct_on.star_projection`, `distinct_on.row_lock`,
  `distinct_on.set_operation`). `Untranslatable::subject()` returns the leaf; the `.refused` suffix
  is gone, a refusal is `enabled=no, reason=missing`. `analyse().constructs` names every form a
  statement needs, refused ones included (tested for every target).
- Matrix rows: a divergence a caller may accept is its own leaf `<construct>.<allowance>`; the strict
  leaf is `no/wrong`. Text collation is read from `config`: `yes` under the fixture collation, with a
  known-bad control (default MySQL/MariaDB `utf8mb4` collation, must diverge) recorded as `no/wrong`.
  `metadata` carries `suite` and `test`.
- `docs/LEAF-CONTRACTS.tsv` with a test that keeps it in step with the matrix files.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-14

- **Breaking (matrix files):** rows follow PersistAnt's merged row schema (DESIGN-KINDS.md section
  2.4 at 4fed258e): `how`/`evidence` are replaced by `config`, `enabled` (yes|no), `reason` and
  `metadata` (`tier=..;suite=..`). A refusal is `enabled=no, reason=missing`. Leaf ids and the MySQL
  default-collation known-bad run are not part of this change (still waiting on PersistAnt D2-D6).

## 0.0.3 - 2026-10-13

- `unisql::analyse(sql, source)`: target-free needs extraction (`constructs`, `refused`, `unreadable`),
  backed by a new IR walker in `unisql-core` (`needs::constructs`) and `Allowance::ALL`. Requested by
  the PersistAnt lane for deriving a program's needs from its statement catalogue.

## 0.0.2

- Lane `HANDOFF.md` is no longer tracked and is ignored (hygiene; no code change).

## 0.0.1

- First tracked state of UniSQL: IR, PostgreSQL/SQLite/MySQL/MariaDB readers and writers, parameter
  codec for array parameters, differential suites against real engines, matrix files, first CI.
